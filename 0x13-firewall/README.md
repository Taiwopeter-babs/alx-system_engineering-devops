#	Firewall Configuration

Firewalls secure networks based on predetermined rules, and they are important for the protection of communication protocols e.g ```HTTP 80``` ```SSH 22``` ```HTTPS SSL 443```
Firewalls can be network-based or Host-based.

This project covers the configuration of ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) for the security of Nginx servers
