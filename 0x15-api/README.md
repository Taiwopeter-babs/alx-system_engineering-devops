# API (Application Programming Interface)

APIs are parts of software that contain sets of routines, rules, and protocols that enable different applications to communicate with each other.

There are different architectural API protocols, namely:

- REST (Representational State Transfer)
- SOAP (Simple Object Access protocols)

APIs have prevalent use in the microservices architectural style in the design and development of applications.
